        <p> Merry! Christmas, Ricky
            Merry! Christmas, Rachel
            Can we open our presents?
            No, we can't
            I have an idea. Let's make breakfast
            That sound fun
            Ricky, We don't know how to cook.
            Don't worry, We can use the toast. And the microwave
            Oh! no, the toast is burning
            Ricky, the microwave
            It's six o'clock in the moring. What are you doing?
            We are making breakfast. Sorry Mom.
            Me too, sorry!
            That's OK. Let's open the present first.
            Hurray!
            This one is for you, Ricky.
            Here's one for you, Rachel.
            Wow, I like it!
            It's the doll I wanted!.
            This is for you, Mom and Dad.
            Thank you! They are beautiful!
            Merry Christmas everyone!
